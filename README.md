<h1 align="center">Hello 👋, I'm Cherry!</h1>
<h4 align="center">I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student on a mission to make a difference!</h4>
<h4 align="center">Here's a glimpse of what I bring to the table: </h4>

- 💼 **Experience:** I've got over 5 years of experience in customer-centric roles, both in and outside of the coding world. Plus, I've got over 2 years of hands-on experience crafting applications and solutions using a variety of technologies and programming languages.

- 🌟 **DEIA:** I am passionate about diversity, equity, inclusion, and access as most of my strengths lie within my intrinsic values of caring for people. My ideal job involves user-oriented design: either working directly with stakeholders or making products that directly impact them.

- 🌐 **Notable Achievements:** In the past year, I am most proud of the following positions that I held:
  1. 📊 **Data Analyst at Air Partners:** I served as a data analyst student researcher at [Air Partners](https://airpartners.org/), where I was the sole member of the Ambient Team. I analyzed data from 18 outdoor sensors in Roxbury, managing everything from data retrieval through API to creating user-friendly plots to drive policy changes regarding Roxbury's railroad system and access to quality air. Alongside the HEPA subteam that works mainly with indoor air sensors, our work directly benefited the Roxbury/Dorchester community. We served as technical experts who worked closely with our partners from Alternatives for [Community and Environment (ACE)](https://ace-ej.org/), who manage the policy and community engagement side of the project, to tailor our work to their needs.

  2. ⚡ **Co-creator of Mehndi Bot:** In the [Mehndi Didi](https://olincollege.github.io/pie-2022-03/mehndi-bot/) project, I wore multiple hats as a project manager and electrical lead. I handled a significant portion of the electrical system and firmware for the project, as well as worked on hand recognition code. In addition, I undertook the crucial task of meticulously tracking project deadlines and monitoring the progress of each team member, ensuring we stayed on course. I also dedicated myself to fostering a harmonious and productive team dynamic, recognizing that success is not just about the technology but the people behind it.
  
My journey is all about making technology work for people and fostering a positive team environment. Let's connect and make great things happen! 😄✨
